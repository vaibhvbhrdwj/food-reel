     * The V2 API enhances security by verifying the entire payload using JWT. This API
     * is in beta.
     *
     * ImageKit.io allows you to upload files directly from both the server and client
     * sides. For server-side uploads, private API key authentication is used. For
     * client-side uploads, generate a one-time `token` from your secure backend using
     * private API.
     * [Learn more](/docs/api-reference/upload-file/upload-file-v2#how-to-implement-secure-client-side-file-upload)
     * about how to implement secure client-side file upload.
     *
     * **File size limit** \
     * On the free plan, the maximum upload file sizes are 20MB for images, audio, and raw
     * files, and 100MB for videos. On the paid plan, these limits increase to 40MB for
     * images, audio, and raw files, and 2GB for videos. These limits can be further increased
     * with higher-tier plans.
     *
     * **Version limit** \
     * A file can have a maximum of 100 versions.
     *
